## My process

First im maked all layout in resolution 375px using resposive viewer, after i builded layout of desktop

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how create o layout mobile first, and i really liked the process, im builded all site in ReactJS and used components, i learned too best ways do you format code.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Here write Title</h1>
```
```css
:root {
  --white: #fff;
}
.title {
  color: var(--white);
}
```
```js
const Cards = [
  {
    id: 1;
    name: 'Onlide Bank',
    desc: `Our modern web and mobile ..`,
    img: './img/bank.svg',
  }
]
```

### Continued development

I really enjoyed using mobile first, and I intend to continue, and start with sass/scss;
